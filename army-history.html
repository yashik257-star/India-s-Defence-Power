    <p>The history of the Indian Army is one of courage, discipline, and an unbroken legacy of service to the nation. 
        Its origins can be traced back to the 17th century when the East India Company formed its own military units
         using Indian soldiers, known as sepoys. After the Revolt of 1857, the British Crown took direct control and 
         reorganized the forces, shaping the structure that continued until India’s independence.</p>
    <p>A major turning point came in 1947, when the Indian Army became the national force of independent India,
         taking full responsibility for safeguarding the country's borders. Since then, it has played a crucial 
         role in defending sovereignty and maintaining peace. The Army fought major wars in 1947–48, 1962, 1965, 1971, 
         and 1999 (Kargil War), each time demonstrating unmatched bravery and resilience.</p>
    <p>The Indian Army is also known for its contributions beyond war. It plays a vital role in disaster relief,
         counter-terrorism, UN peacekeeping, and supporting civilians during emergencies. It stands as one of the 
         largest and most respected armies in the world.</p>
    <p>The motto “Service Before Self” reflects the spirit of every soldier who prioritizes the nation above personal life.
         Their sacrifices, discipline, and unwavering commitment form the backbone of India’s security.
         Every citizen should know that the Indian Army is not just a military force—it is a symbol of national pride, unity, 
         and courage, protecting India day and night.</p>
