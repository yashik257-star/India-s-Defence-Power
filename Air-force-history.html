    <h1>History of Indian Air Force</h1>

<div class="container history-section">
    <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) was formed on 8 October 1932, beginning with a small fleet of Wapiti biplanes 
        and a handful of Indian officers trained under the British. During World War II, the IAF earned respect for its
        crucial role in the Burma campaign, which laid the foundation for its future growth. After independence in 1947, 
        it became the Indian Air Force, playing a decisive role in defending the nation in all major conflicts — from the 
        1947–48 Kashmir operations to the wars of 1965 and 1971, where air power played a key part in India’s victory and 
        the creation of Bangladesh. The IAF again proved its mastery during the 1999 Kargil War, carrying out precision
         strikes at high altitudes under extreme conditions. Over the years, it has transformed from using foreign aircraft 
         to developing indigenous strength through projects like HAL Tejas, Dhruv, Astra missiles, and the upcoming AMCA. 
         Beyond warfare, the IAF is known for major humanitarian rescue missions, disaster relief, evacuation operations, 
         and global peace efforts. Today, it stands as one of the world’s most powerful air forces, symbolizing courage, 
         discipline, technological excellence, and national pride — qualities that every Indian should recognize and respect.</p>
